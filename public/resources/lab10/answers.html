    <h2>
        Question 1:
    </h2>
    <p>
        1 - Timers Queue: This queu is the one that will take of the setTimeOut and setInterval callbacks.<br>
        2 - I/O Queue: This will take care about I/O related callbacks, such as network requests and file system.<br>
        3 - nextTick Queue: Takes care of those callbacks used in the nextTick, waiting this current process to end to
        then get started;<br>
        4 - Imediate Queue: it works like the timers queue, but has a bigger priority;<br>
        5 - Close Queue: handles close event callbacks.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 2:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Output:<br>
        start <br>
        end<br>
        nextTick 1<br>
        nextTick 2<br>
        Promise...1<br>
        Promise...2<br>
        timeout 1<br>
        timeout 2<br>
        nextTick 3<br>
        timeout 3<br>
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 3:
    </h2>
    <p>
        My expectation was:<br>
        Immediate<br>
        timeout<br>
        readFile...<br><br>
        This because setImediate has more priority than timers, then timeout would fall into place, followed by readFile
        But, when running it locally I found it different. It seems like because of the enviroment of my
        computer.<br><br>
        Output:<br>
        timeout<br>
        readFile....<br>
        Immediate
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 4:
    </h2>
    <p>
        In browser the output is: Hello World<br>
        In node.js it was undefined.<br>
        This happened because in node, to create a variable in the global object, you don't use var, let nor const,
        that's why its output was undefined.<br>
        On the other hand, the result came out Hello World in the broswer because when using this sintax, the object is
        created in the Global (Window) object, working properly.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 5:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The error is on the last line. It happens because on the file, the exportations happens properly, but to use the
        method,
        we need to access it with '.'.<br>
        The correct way would be getName.getName();<br>
        The first getName receives the properties being exported from pattern.js, we need then access it to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 6:
    </h2>
    <p>
        It will throw an error because in app.js the import made is referencing to an unexistent module on the very
        first
        line of app.js, but
        if the import was correct, it would print "Josh Edward".
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 7:
    </h2>
    <p>
        It will throw an error because in app.js the import made is referencing to an unexistent module on the very
        first
        line of app.js,
        but if the import was correct, it wouldn't work because the named property which is a functions is passed, then
        on the last line it had to be "getFullName.getFullName(), and the output would be "Josh Edward".
    </p>

    <h2>
        Question 8:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Because apply is being used, the context passed to the function is null and export and module are empty.
        What those values are don't make much difference in this case, it will just make the reference of the function
        in
        the const
        result able to be called without "()" as a callback function. If it werent for the apply, the console would
        print
        the function itself,
        but the way it is, the output will be the module.exports object: {firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Smith'}.
